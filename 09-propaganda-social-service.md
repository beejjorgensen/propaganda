PROPAGANDA IN SOCIAL SERVICE
:::

[The]{.small-caps} public relations counsel is necessary to social work.
And since social service, by its very nature, can continue only by means
of the voluntary support of the wealthy, it is obliged to use propaganda
continually. The leaders in social service were among the first
consciously to utilize propaganda in its modern sense.

The great enemy of any attempt to change men's habits is inertia.
Civilization is limited by inertia.

Our attitude toward social relations, toward economics, toward national
and international politics, continues past attitudes and strengthens
them under the force of tradition. Comstock drops his mantle of
proselytizing morality on the willing shoulders of a Sumner; Penrose
drops his mantle on Butler; Carnegie his on Schwab, and so _ad
infinitum_. Opposing this traditional acceptance of existing ideas is an
active public opinion that has been directed consciously into movements
against inertia. Public opinion was made or changed formerly by tribal
chiefs, by kings, by religious leaders. To-day the privilege of
attempting to sway public opinion is every one's. It is one of the
manifestations of democracy that any one may try to convince others and
to assume leadership on behalf of his own thesis.

New ideas, new precedents, are continually striving for a place in the
scheme of things.

The social settlement, the organized campaigns
against tuberculosis and cancer, the various research
activities aiming directly at the elimination of social
diseases and maladjustments—a multitude of altru-
istic activities which could be catalogued only in a
book of many pages—have need of knowledge of the
public mind and mass psychology if they are to
achieve their aims. The literature on social service
publicity is so extensive, and the underlying prin-
ciples so fundamental, that only one example is nec-
essary here to illustrate the technique of social service
propaganda.

A social service organization undertook to fight
lynching, Jim Crowism and the civil discriminations
against the Negro below the Mason and Dixon line.

The National Association for the Advancement of
- the Colored People had the fight in hand. As a
matter of technique they decided to dramatize the
year's campaign in an annual convention which would
concentrate attention on the problem. .

Should it be held in the North, South, West or
East? Since the purpose was to affect the entire coun-
try, the association was advised to hold it in the
South. For, said the propagandist, a point of view
on a southern question, emanating from a southern

136

center, would have greater authority than the same
point of view issuing from any other locality, par-
ticularly when that point of view was at odds with
the traditional southern point of view. Atlanta
was chosen.

The - third step was to surround the conference
with people who were stereotypes for ideas that car-
ried weight all over the country. The support of
leaders of diversified groups was sought. Tele-
grams and letters were dispatched to leaders of re-
ligious, political, social and educational groups, ask-
ing for their point of view on the purpose of the
conference. But in addition to these group leaders
of national standing it was particularly important
from the technical standpoint to secure the opinions
of group leaders of the South, even from Atlanta it-
'self, to emphasize the purposes of the conference to
the entire public. There was one group in Atlanta
which could be approached. A group of ministers
had been bold enough to come out for a greater inter-
racial amity. This group was approached and agreed
to codperate in the conference.

The event ran off as scheduled. The program
itself followed the general scheme. Negroes and
white men from the South, on the same platform, ex-
pressed the same point of view.

A dramatic element was spot-lighted here and
there. A national leader from Massachusetts agreed

137

in principle and in practice with a Baptist preacher
from the South.

If the radio had been in effect, the whole country
might have heard and been moved by the speeches
and the principles expressed.

But the public read the words and the ideas in
the press of the country. .For the event had been
created of such important component parts as to
awaken interest throughout the country and to gain
support for its ideas even in the South.

The editorials in the southern press, reflecting the
public opinion of their communities, showed that the
subject had become one of interest to the editors
because of the participation by southern leaders.

The event naturally gave the Association itself
substantial weapons with which to appeal to an in-
creasingly wider circle. Further publicity was at-
tained by mailing reports, letters, and other propa-
ganda to selected groups of the public.

As for the practical results, the immediate one
was a change in the minds of many southern editors
who realized that the question at issue was not only

-an emotional one, but also a discussable one; and
this point of view was immediately reflected to their
readers. Further results are hard to measure with a
slide-rule. The conference had its definite effect in
building up the racial consciousness and solidarity of
the Negroes. The decline in lynching is very prob-

138

ably a result of this and other efforts of the Associa-
tion.

Many churches have made paid advertising and
organized propaganda part of their regular activities.
They have developed church advertising committees,
which make use of the newspaper and the billboard,
as well as of the pamphlet. Many denominations
maintain their own periodicals. The Methodist
Board of Publication and Information systematically
gives announcements and releases to the press and
the magazines.

But in a broader sense the very activities of social
service are propaganda activities. A campaign for
the preservation of the teeth seeks to alter people's
habits in the direction of more frequent brushing of
teeth. A campaign for better parks seeks to alter
people's opinion in regard to the desirability of tax-
ing themselves for the purchase of park facilities. A
campaign against tuberculosis is an attempt to con-
vince everybody that tuberculosis can be cured, that
persons with certain symptoms should immediately
go to the doctor, and the like. A campaign to lower
the infant mortality rate is an effort to alter the
habits of mothers in regard to feeding, bathing and
caring for their babies. Social service, in fact, is
identical with propaganda in many cases.

Even those aspects of social service which are
governmental and administrative, rather than chari-
table and spontaneous, depend on wise propaganda

for their effectiveness. Professor Harry FElmer
Barnes, in his book, "The Evolution of Modern Pe-
nology in Pennsylvania," states that improvements
in penological administration in that state are ham-
pered by political influences. The legislature must
be persuaded to permit the utilization of the best
methods of scientific penology, and for this there is
necessary the development of an enlightened public
opinion. "Until such a situation has been brought
about," Mr. Barnes states, "progress in penology is
doomed to be sporadic, local, and generally ineffec-
tive. The solution of prison problems, then, seems
to be fundamentally a problem of conscientious and
scientific publicity."

Social progress is simply the progressiver education
and enlightenment of the public mind in regard to its
immediate and distant social problems.
